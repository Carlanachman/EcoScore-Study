# EcoScore-Study

## About 
The Eco-score is an indicator representing the environmental impact of food products. It classifies products into 5 categories (A, B, C, D, E), from the lowest to the highest impact.
Our aim is to optimize our food choices so as to have less impact on the environment, and thus be greener.


## Contenants
Here's a file named Projet_FMAD consisting of :
- a file project.py, containing the project's code parts 
- a text file containing a link to a colab file also containing the project's code parts 
- an xlsx file containing the data used
- a text file report.pdf containing answers to questions, as well as some explanations and images


## Installation
1. Download the Projet_FMAD zip file
2. Launch the project, we give you 2 possibilities: 
  
  a) Use an IDLE, like pyzo, to launch the projet.py program
  make sure the AGRIBALYSE3 file is in the same directory as the .py file
  
  b) Use the colab link in the text file colab.txt
  be sure to download the AGRIBALYSE3 file before executing the code parts. 
  
3. Before execution, don't forget to install the various packages (these are the 1st lines of code) and import them. 


## Project status
We have completed all the questions despite some bugs in the 2 L1_inv and L1_inv_eco graphs.
